### Hopefully, in the near future, there will be some drastic changes in life. For that reason, I'll make some bullet points regarding my post academic life 

### Word of wisdom from this [website](https://www.prepscholar.com/gre/blog/sample-graduate-school-resume-cv/)

> Graduate school resumes should highlight all of your major academic and professional experiences and accomplishments — particularly those most relevant to your field of study. This means you should tailor your resume to your field of study and avoid padding it with too many irrelevant experiences. (That said, some programs may ask you to include your entire professional history, irrelevant positions and all. In this case, don’t leave anything out!)

> In addition, don’t go overboard with your descriptions. Each entry (even those that are highly relevant to your field) should only contain as much detail as is necessary without devolving into verbosity. Generally, anywhere from two to four bullet points per entry should suffice.
